#### Which ML-powered feature will you choose and why?

I chose three months prediction with Facebook Prophet because:
- Corporate identity: Prophet is, along with React, a Facebook (Meta) product.
- Ease: The problem of predicting three months (or 12 weeks) is really clear. I have experience with the Facebook Prophet library. On the other hand, the sentiment analysis is still an open problem. Flutter repo has +11k unsolved issues, some with several comments, making this problem a massive work that would need hardware infrastructure, at least a virtual machine with GPU. 
- Don't use a cannon to kill a fly: Each repository object from the Algolia Autocomplete GitHub plugin comes with a description. We don't need fancy Tensorflow/Pytorch Large Language Models to do that, just calling the object description.

#### What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?
If sentiment analysis is needed, it can be a bottleneck. Analyzing thousands of comments/issues is not an easy task. Maybe if we analyze random comments, one by one, would be more tackable. 

#### What changes/additions would you make to the design?
- Graph axes do not have titles: Maybe from a designer's minimalistic perspective it looks more aesthetic, but in data science charts must always be properly labeled.
- ML assignments do not have Figma design, so I had to infer how to design the prediction part of the graph.

#### List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
- Sort selected repositories by popularity (stargazers).
- Search not only by full name but also by description or keywords in the readme file.

#### Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions.

- Will I have a technical meeting to present the assignment solution?
- What time do I have today to submit a final version of the assignment? When we are solving these technical tests, the feeling of being able to improve it further never ends.
- I took 7 hours for the assignment. How would the payment be? Would it be via wire transfer? What information do you need from me for making the payment?
